        Why are you doing this study?
      </h3>
      <p style=""margin-bottom: 15px;"">You are being asked to participate in a research study that aims to understand if there is a relationship between mindfulness, the ability to pay attention, and life satisfaction.</p>

Your participation will help us better understand if mindfulness and attention do have a significant effect on life satisfaction (i.e., how people feel about their lives overall). Then you will be asked to perform a conjunction visual search task to test your capacity to direct your attention over a sustained period.</p>
