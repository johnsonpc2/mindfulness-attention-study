      <p style=""margin-bottom: 15px;"">I am a student at the University at Albany, in the Department of Psychology. I am planning to conduct a research study, which I invite you to take part in.</p>
      
      <p style=""margin-bottom: 25px;"">This form has important information about the reasons for doing this study, what we will ask you to do, and the way we would like to use the information we collect about you.</p>

      <h3 style=""color: #333; font-size: 18px; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-weight: bold;"">
        Why are you doing this study?
      </h3>
      <p style=""margin-bottom: 15px;"">You are being asked to participate in a research study that aims to understand if there is a relationship between mindfulness, the ability to pay attention, and life satisfaction.</p>
      
      <p style=""margin-bottom: 25px;"">The purpose of this study is to investigate if having better control over one's attention influences overall life satisfaction. Your participation will help us better understand if mindfulness and attention do have a significant effect on life satisfaction (i.e., how people feel about their lives overall). Then you will be asked to perform a conjunction visual search task to test your capacity to direct your attention over a sustained period.</p>

      <h3 style=""color: #333; font-size: 18px; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-weight: bold;"">

      <p style=""margin-bottom: 8px; margin-left: 20px;"">3. Read instructions for the visual search task, which asks you to indicate if a target (a red triangle) is present among various other colored shapes.

      <p style=""margin-bottom: 25px; margin-left: 20px;"">6.	After all questionnaires are completed, participants will be thanked for their time and will be provided the study debriefing. Following the debriefing, you will be sent back to the SONA research site.</p>

      <h3 style=""color: #333; font-size: 18px; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-weight: bold;"">
        For how long will I participate?
      </h3>
      <p style=""margin-bottom: 25px;"">This study is a single online session that you can complete on a computer. The study can be completed in less than 30 minutes but could require as long as 45 minutes to complete.</p>

      <h3 style=""color: #333; font-size: 18px; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-weight: bold;"">
        Where will I need to go to participate?

      <p style=""margin-bottom: 25px;"">The risks associated with participating in this study are minimal; however, you may experience mild discomfort when reflecting on your mindfulness or life satisfaction when answering questionnaires in the study. To help minimize this, you can withdraw from the study at any time without any consequences. The study will take place online, and you will have the opportunity to take breaks while completing the survey to reduce the risk of eye strain associated with the use of electronic devices.</p>

      <h3 style=""color: #333; font-size: 18px; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 10px; font-weight: bold;"">
        What are the possible benefits for me or others?

      <p style=""margin-bottom: 25px;"">While there are no direct personal benefits to participants of this study, you may find value in reflecting on your mindfulness, attention, and its impact on life satisfaction by completing this survey. The data you contribute may help advance society's understanding of how mindfulness and attention relate to overall well-being, potentially informing future programs or interventions aimed at improving student mental health, attention, and life satisfaction.</p>

If results of this study are published or presented, only de-identified summaries of data will be used.</p>
      
      <p style=""margin-bottom: 25px;"">To minimize the risks to confidentiality, all data will be collected anonymously via Pavlovia.org which uses encryption to protect information (https://pavlovia.org/docs/home/ethics). Only the student researcher (Ella Bremmer), mentor (Pierce Johnson), and faculty advisor (Gregory Cox) will have password-protected access to the data. Data will be stored on secure, university approved computers.</p>

        The Effects of Mindfulness and Attention on Life Satisfaction and Memory

        Study Purpose
      </h2>
      <p style=""margin-bottom: 15px;"">The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between attention, mindfulness, and life satisfaction. Specifically, we wanted to explore whether:</p>
      <ul style=""margin: 10px 0 15px 25px; padding: 0;"">
        <li style=""margin-bottom: 8px;"">Greater levels of mindfulness (awareness of the present moment) are associated with better attentional control (the ability to focus on specific aspects of the environement while 'tuning out' distractions)</li>
        <li style=""margin-bottom: 8px;"">Mindfulness and attention are related to overall life satisfaction</li>
        <li style=""margin-bottom: 8px;"">These relationships hold across people with different levels of conscientiousness</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 style=""color: #555; font-size: 20px; margin-top: 30px; border-bottom: 2px solid #e0e0e0; padding-bottom: 8px;"">
        What We Learned from Your Participation
      </h2>
      <p style=""margin-bottom: 15px;"">The visual search task you completed measures your ability to focus attention and efficiently locate target objects among distractors. This basic cognitive ability may be related to mindfulness practices in everyday life.</p>
      
      <p style=""margin-bottom: 15px;"">The questionnaires you completed help us understand your typical level of mindfulness, your satisfaction with life, and your personality characteristics (most importantly, conscientiousness). By combining data from the visual search task with your survey responses, we can examine how mindfulness and attention may relate to experiences at both a large scale (life satisfaction) and small scale (visual attention).</p>

        How Your Data Will Be Used
      </h2>
      <p style=""margin-bottom: 15px;"">Your anonymous responses will be combined with data from other participants to identify patterns and relationships between mindfulness, attention, and life satisfaction. The results may:</p>
      <ul style=""margin: 10px 0 15px 25px; padding: 0;"">
        <li style=""margin-bottom: 8px;"">Help inform mental health professionals about the potential benefits of mindfulness practices</li>
        <li style=""margin-bottom: 8px;"">Contribute to educational programs that support student well-being</li>
        <li style=""margin-bottom: 8px;"">Advance our understanding of how everyday awareness relates to cognitive functioning</li>
        <li style=""margin-bottom: 8px;"">Be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals and presented at academic conferences</li>
      </ul>
